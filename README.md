# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Functionality:
* CD to develop in terminal
* run node app.js
* Enter team member info
* Wait for HTML to build
* Open output/team.html to see your team!

The main item I focused on this project was making sure my code was readable and reliable. I did a lot of debugging on this project to make sure it would run smoothly, while also being readable code. In a few instances, I've left error codes just in the event there is a case I missed.
I had a lot of issues with bouncing around on what I was doing. I would think my constructors should be working, but hadn't built them in a function yet. This led to a lot of errors I pulled my hair out at, just to realize I needed to define them.
For the future, I want to make the HTML file auto-open and update after running app.js, and would also like to add more functionality than just three classes. In summary, frustrating but highly rewarding project I enjoyed working on.
